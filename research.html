        <h1>Accreting Compact Objects</h1>
        <p>My main research area focuses on low-mass X-ray binaries - binary systems consisting of a low-mass
        star in orbit with either a neutron star or a black hole. The companion star transfers matter on to
        the primary via an accretion disc. LMXBs often exhibit transient outbursts, characterised by a huge
        increase in flux, followed by a gradual decay on varying timescales of days to months.</p>
        <p>During my PhD I spent the majority of my time studying
        <a href="http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-basic?Ident=swift+j1753.5-0127&submit=SIMBAD+search" target="_blank">
        Swift J1753.5-0127</a>, an unusual black hole system which outburst in 2005 and only returned to
        quiescence in late 2016. During it's near 12 year outburst it showed remarkable variability,
        as well as a short term excursion to a very low-luminosity soft accretion state. I am still
        very much involved with this fascinating system and I am very interested in learning the reason
        behind its unusually long period of activity. Something which I have worked on (with others)
        during my postdoc. For more information, see some of the

        <p>I have also been involved in the 2015 outburst of the famous black hole transient
        <a href="http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-basic?Ident=V404+Cyg&submit=SIMBAD+search" target="_blank">
        V404 Cygni</a>, which was the first black hole to have its mass accurately measured. With the advance in technology
        we have had since the initial discovery in 1989, we have been able to study V404 Cyg in unprecedented
        detail. At Southampton, I was involved in a number of different aspects of this most recent outburst
        resulting in a <a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/news/2016/03/red-flares-black-hole.page" target="_blank">
        Press Release</a> that was picked up by many news outlets. I also, with extreme luck, managed to obtain
        a spectrum of V404 Cyg just thirteen hours before it went into outburst, making it the world's first
        'pre-outburst' spectrum of a black hole. Recently, I have been involved with a Nature Astronomy
        paper which found that the base of the jet in V404 Cyg is elevated by 0.1 light seconds.
        You can read some of the papers that I have been involved with on V404 Cyg

        <p>
        <p>Since my move to Edmonton, I have started to become more involved with binaries in globular
        clusters. The high stellar densities make them ideal locations for the dynamical
        formation of binaries and we find an abundance of X-ray binaries, millisecond pulsars and CVs
        in globular clusters. Telescopes like Chandra have discovered an population of quiescent
        low-mass X-ray binaries containing neutron stars, the X-ray spectra of which we can fit with
        model atmospheres, thereby constraining the neutron star radius. This has significant consequences
        for the neutron star equation of state, one of the important unanswered questions in modern
        day physics. I recently published a paper <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.476.4713S/abstract" target="_blank">
        constraining the radius of the neutron star</a> in the quiescent low-mass X-ray binary in M13.

        <h1>Magnetic White Dwarfs</h1>
        <p>
          Recently, I successfully proposed a ~1 Ms Legacy Survey with
          <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/nustar/main/index.html" target="_blank">
          NuSTAR</a> to study magnetic cataclysmic variables. These systems consist of white dwarfs
          accreting material onto their poles from their companions along magnetic field lines.
          The infalling plasma forms a standing shock above the surface of the white dwarf, with
          a temperature directly related to its mass.
          <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.476..554S/abstract" target="_blank"> Modelling of
          the X-ray spectrum enables us to derive the mass of the white dwarf</a>.
          A large scale survey such as the one I am leading will allow us to infer a mass distribution
          of magnetic WDs and draw comparisons to single white dwarfs and non-magnetic CVs.
        </p>
        <p>
          This mass distribution has important implications for binary evolution. It has been found
          that CVs seem to be more massive than post common envelope binaries ("pre-CVs"), as well
          as single white dwarfs. Why does this happen? Do CVs preferentially form above the period
          gap with larger masses? Or do they gain mass through accretion? Does this mass distribution
          hold for magnetic CVs? These are questions which we hope to be able to answer with the
          Legacy survey.
