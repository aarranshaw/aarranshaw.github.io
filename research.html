        <h1>Accreting Compact Objects</h1>
        <p>My main research area focuses on accreting compact objects - binary systems consisting of a
          stellar remnant of some decription (either a white dwarf, neutron star or black hole) accreting
          matter from a normal (usually main sequence) star. My research can be subdivided into studies of
          low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs; containing a neutron star or black hole), and
          accreting white dwarfs (AWDs; often known as cataclysmic variables).</p>
        <p>To accomplish my research, I employ a variety of analysis techniques, ranging from X-ray spectroscopy
        and imaging, to photometry and spectroscopy in the optical and infrared bands.
        I am also interested in timing analysis and owe a great debt to open source software such as
      <a href="http://stingraysoftware.github.io" target="_blank">Stingray</a> that make learning
        such techniques easy and accessible. <a href="http://www.astropy.org/affiliated/index.html" target="_blank">
        Astropy</a> has also been a huge help throughout my career.</p>

          <h2><u>Low-Mass X-ray Binaries</u></h2>

        <p>During my PhD I spent the majority of my time studying LMXBs, focusing in particular on such systems
          as <a href="http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-basic?Ident=swift+j1753.5-0127&submit=SIMBAD+search" target="_blank">
          Swift J1753.5-0127</a> and <a href="http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-basic?Ident=V404+Cyg&submit=SIMBAD+search" target="_blank">
          V404 Cygni</a>. These exhibit transient outbursts, characterised by a huge
          increase in flux, followed by a gradual decay on varying timescales of days to months.</p>

            <figcaption>Artist's impression of an X-ray binary: Material from the
              companion star forms an accretion disk around the compact object which
              emits across the electromagnetic spectrum. We also see collimated
              jets emanating from close to the compact object. (Image Credit: R. Hynes)</figcaption>
          </center>
        </figure>
        <p>

        <p>After finishing my PhD, my research started to branch out and I became more involved
          with studies of poorly understood subsets of accreting binaries. Most X-ray transients (such
          as the two mentioned above) exhibit peak X-ray luminosities of &gsim;10<sup>36</sup> erg
          s<sup>-1</sup>. However, a fainter class of X-ray sources known as Very Faint X-ray Transients
          (VFXTs) display lower peak luminosities of &sim;10<sup>34-36</sup> erg s<sup>-1</sup> exists,
          which are relatively understudied compared to their more luminous counterparts.</p>

        <p>A collaboration which I am part of initiated the Swift Bulge Survey, a biweekly X-ray survey of the
          Galactic bulge with the <a href="https://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov" target="_blank"> Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory,</a>
          in order to detect new and known VFXTs, characterize their variability, and derive their natures.
        Near infrared follow-up (led by myself) of sources detected in the survey revealed that
          binaries containing (sub)giant stars may make a substantial contribution to the VFXT population.
          See my <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.492.4344S/abstract" target="_blank">paper</a> on
          some of our results from the survey.</p>

          <h2><u>Accreting White Dwarfs</u></h2>

        <p>Aside from neutron stars and black holes, I also have a keen interest in AWDs, in
        particular, a subclass of them called magnetic cataclysmic variables (mCVs). These systems consist of white dwarfs
        accreting material onto their poles from their companions along magnetic field lines.
        The infalling plasma forms a standing shock above the surface of the white dwarf, with
        a temperature directly related to its mass.</p>

        <figure>

            <img src="images/mCV_low-res.png" height="256" width="384">
            <figcaption>Artistâ€™s impression of a magnetic cataclysmic variable:
              Material from the companion star flows towards the hot white dwarf and
              forms an accretion disk. The magnetic field of the white dwarf is strong
              enough to disrupt the innermost regions of the disk, forcing the material
              to flow along the magnetic field lines on to the poles of the white dwarf.

        <p><a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.476..554S/abstract" target="_blank"> Modelling of
        the X-ray spectrum enables us to derive the mass of the white dwarf</a>.  I was the PI of a ~1 Ms Legacy
        Survey of magnetic CVs with the
        <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/nustar/main/index.html" target="_blank">
        NuSTAR</a> hard X-ray telescope. This survey allowed us to derive the mass distribution of magnetic
        white dwarfs and draw comparisons to single white dwarfs and non-magnetic CVs, which has important
        consequences for theories of accretion-nova cycles as well as binary evolution. See our
        paper on the survey <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.498.3457S/abstract" target="_blank">
        here</a>, and the related <a href="https://www.nustar.caltech.edu/news/118" target="_blank">
        NuSTAR news item</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
        In addition, I have a strong interest in understanding the mysterious "low states" that some intermediate polars
        (a subclass of mCVs). In 2022, UNR undergraduate Ava Covington
        <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...928..164C/abstract" target="_blank">published a paper </a>
        on six such objects that exhibited (seemingly random) transitions to a low-flux state. Using publicly
        available data from the <a href="https://www.aavso.org" target="_blank"> American Association of
        Variable Star Observers</a>, Ava performed timing analysis in and out of the low states, finding that
        some of them showed wholesale changes in their accretion modes as they transitioned. Gaining a complete
        understanding of the physical mechanisms at work during intermediate polar low states requires combining
        optical spectroscopy, photometry, and X-ray observations, and is something I am actively working on.
